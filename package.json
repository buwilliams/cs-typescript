  "description": "This repository is an ongoing project as I rehearse known skills and add new skills. This includes concepts such as data structures, algorithms, and data systems. While many of the concepts are already known to me, my goal is to rehearse that knowledge as well and improve on it. Furthermore, it makes sense to get really good at a specific skill such as TypeScript. Since I have worked with many language over the years, JS continues to be the predominate language for me so I'll continue to improve that skill.",
